## Best Practices for AI Communication

### DO:
- Provide exact error messages
- Include relevant code snippets
- Mention recent changes
- Test in multiple browsers when possible
- Check both development and production environments

### DON'T:
- Say "it's broken" without specifics
- Skip error messages or logs
- Assume the AI knows your recent changes
- Mix multiple unrelated issues in one request

## Common Solutions to Try First

Before asking for help, try these quick fixes:

### 1. Cache and Refresh Issues
```bash
# Clear browser cache or try incognito mode
# Use the refresh button in Playbook section
# Restart development server
npm run dev
```

### 2. RSS Feed Problems
```bash
# Test the RSS feed directly
curl "https://shivacharanmandhapuram.substack.com/feed"

# Check API endpoint
curl "http://localhost:5000/api/playbook-feed"
```

### 3. Build Issues
```bash
# Clean install
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install

# Clear build cache
rm -rf dist
npm run build
```

### 4. TypeScript Errors
```bash
# Check TypeScript compilation
npx tsc --noEmit

# Restart TypeScript server in IDE
# CMD+Shift+P > "TypeScript: Restart TS Server"
```

## Useful Commands for Debugging

```bash
# Check current status
npm run dev

# Test API endpoints
curl "http://localhost:5000/api/playbook-feed?page=1"

# Check build output
