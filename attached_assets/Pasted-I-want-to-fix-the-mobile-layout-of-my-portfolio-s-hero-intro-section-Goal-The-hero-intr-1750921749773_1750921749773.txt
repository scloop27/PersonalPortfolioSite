I want to fix the mobile layout of my portfolio's hero (intro) section.

**Goal:**  
- The hero/intro section (the one with "Hi, I'm Shiva — a 21 year old founder...") should always fill the entire viewport on mobile, so when someone opens the site, they see ONLY this intro section—nothing below—until they scroll.
- The intro text should be vertically and horizontally centered in the viewport.
- The navigation bar should stay at the top, but the hero content should be perfectly centered beneath it.
- The spacing, font size, and alignment should look as clean and balanced as advaitpaliwal.com on mobile.

**Instructions:**  
1. **CSS/Classes:**  
   - Make the hero section use `min-h-screen` or `min-height: 100vh` (Tailwind or CSS).
   - Use flexbox (`flex`, `flex-col`, `justify-center`, `items-center`) to center the content both vertically and horizontally.
   - Add responsive padding so the text never touches the edges on any phone.
   - Ensure the navigation bar height is accounted for (e.g., use `min-h-[calc(100vh-56px)]` if the navbar is 56px tall, or use `pt-16` if you use sticky/fixed nav).

2. **Mobile-First:**  
   - Test on common mobile breakpoints (375px, 414px, etc.).
   - The intro text should not overflow or be squished; font size should remain readable.

3. **No Color/Content Changes:**  
   - Do NOT change any colors, text, or structure—only fix the alignment and spacing for mobile hero section.

4. **Example (Tailwind):**  
   - The hero section should have classes like:
     ```
     <section className="min-h-screen flex flex-col justify-center items-center px-6">
       {/* intro text */}
     </section>
     ```
   - Or, if you use custom CSS, set:
     ```
     .hero-section {
       min-height: 100vh;
       display: flex;
       flex-direction: column;
       justify-content: center;
       align-items: center;
       padding-left: 1.5rem;
       padding-right: 1.5rem;
     }
     ```

5. **Result:**  
   - On mobile, the user should see ONLY the intro section (with proper spacing and centering) when they open the site, just like advaitpaliwal.com.

Please update the hero section and any related styles/components so the mobile experience matches this expectation.
