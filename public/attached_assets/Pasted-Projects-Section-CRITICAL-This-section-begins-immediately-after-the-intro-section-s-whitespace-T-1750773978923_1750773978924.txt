Projects Section:

CRITICAL: This section begins immediately after the intro section's whitespace. There is NO heading like "My Work" or "Projects".

The section is a list of four projects. Each project is a self-contained row with a two-column layout on desktop.

Layout Pattern: The layout of the columns must alternate for each project row.

Row 1 (Friday): Text on the left, Image on the right.

Row 2 (YouLearn): Image on the left, Text on the right.

Row 3 (Iris): Text on the left, Image on the right.

Row 4 (Commencement Speech): Image on the left, Text on the right.

Content for each project row:

Text Column:

Title: Bold project name (e.g., "Friday").

Description: A short, one or two-line description below the title in a lighter font weight.

"View" Button: A small, light gray, pill-shaped button with the text "View" inside.

Image Column: A placeholder for the project's visual (product UI, photo, or video thumbnail).

Specific Project Content (from image):

Project 1: Title: Friday, Description: AI assistant for email. Backed by Y Combinator.

Project 2: Title: YouLearn, Description: AI tutor for students. 1M+ users.

Project 3: Title: Iris, Description: AI wearable that gives you infinite memory.

5. Footer Section:

This section appears at the very bottom of the page. It has a two-column layout.

Left Column: The name "Advait Paliwal" with "Advait" on the first line and "Paliwal" on the second.

Right Column: A two-column grid of social media links. The links are: X, LinkedIn, GitHub, Instagram, Google Scholar, Substack.

Final Instructions for the Agent:

The final code must be a runnable Next.js project.

The implementation must be fully responsive. On mobile, the two-column project rows should stack vertically (image first, then text content).

The code should be clean, well-commented, and use reusable components (e.g., a ProjectRow component).
