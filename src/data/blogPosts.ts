/**
 * ========================================
 * üìù SHIVA'S AUTHENTIC CONTENT LEVERAGE STRATEGY
 * ========================================
 *
 * Building specific knowledge through documented execution.
 * Each post should answer: "What do I know that others don't?"
 *
 * As Naval teaches: "Specific knowledge is knowledge you cannot be trained for."
 * As Paul Graham writes: "Write about what you've learned, not what you think you should write about."
 *
 * Your blog posts become leverage assets that:
 * - Attract aligned opportunities
 * - Build reputation through authenticity
 * - Create compound content that works while you sleep
 * - Document your unique journey and insights
